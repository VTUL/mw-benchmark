# YCSB4WebServices
This is a modification of the light wieght core module of the Yahoo Cloud Service Benchmarking project to benchmark Web Services. The motivation for this project is the need of an easily and highly configurable tool for benchmarking web services, especially for cloud applications, where synchronization between various clients is needed. Since YCSB does not provide a very flexible and easily configurable way to benchmark web services, I've decided to customize it for now. I've updated the internal core classes like CoreWorkload, Client, Generators etc. Flexibility has also been added to fetch the URL patterns for reads and writes from multiple files. Adidtionally, you can configure Zipf's constant for Read, Write and Write Data Size patterns.
